### Random Variables in Forth

Every few years I wind up searching through various drives, USB sticks, etc. for this code.
Finally learned my lesson, and am putting it on Github.

I have re-worked the code so that it runs under gforth (at least as of 0.7.3) and
have refactored the code based on a few years' of experience since first I wrote it.
